# Interactive Notebooks 

In this folder, it is found some notebooks, which contains the explanation of some parts of the repository. If you want to grasp the different ideas and implementation that took place in this reasearch, I firstly recommend to explore this notebook. 

The steps that I recommend to follow are:

1. Review [environment.ipynb](environment.ipynb) where we proposed the environment where the algorithm took place.
2. Review [proximities_testing.ipynb](proximities_testing.ipynb) where it is studied the proximity. This is a relevant heuristic metric that we used in our algorithm.
3. Review [random_walks.ipynb](random_walks.ipynb) where we studied different random walk algorithm in the context of our environment.
4. Review [aco_pp.ipynb](aco_pp.ipyn) where we defined the main algorithm, and some variants that we implemented in order to solve the PathPlanning problem. This algorithm was based on the state-of-art finding according to [M. Dorigo, M. Birattari and T. Stutzle, "Ant colony optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4129846/), specifically in the algorithm Ant Colony System.

Additional notebooks:

We also have some additional notebooks that where useful during the development of this projects.

1. The notebook [aco_tsp.ipynb](aco_tsp.ipynb) contains a simplified version of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) problem.
2. The notebook [random_maze.ipynb](random_maze.ipynb) contains an algorithm to generate random maze of diferent size. This implementation uses the the [Randomized Primâ€™s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) variant, and we based on the following post for developing our version [Fun With Python #1: Maze Generator](https://medium.com/swlh/fun-with-python-1-maze-generator-931639b4fb7e)

Note: This repository currently is under work.
